##Apples will turn into pies

I love apples in any way, but when converted into pies, nothing can make me happier. The smell of butter and almonds from the crust, the smell of cinnamon and vanilla from the apples puree, what could be more tasty and flavorful than that?

When I was a child, my grandmother had a big garden with a lot of apples trees. In spring, the apples trees were exploding of white and light-pink flowers, and when the wind blew, the little petals were spread as a storm of happiness. I liked to imagine that I’m Alice in Wonderland, I danced and sang and the trees were my best friends. Often I could see my grandmother’s orange cat with her little kittens walking and playing among the trees, happy of the arrival of spring. My grandma, handed me a blanket under tree and I dreamed, I dreamed...

Many of those trees gave fruits in summer, some of them late in fall, but only one of them was so special, so special for me. 

The path leading to the tree had a small, mysterious wooden gate, but so big and hard for me to open it. The tree was old, but in july it gave us very, very sweet, little treasures from what my grandmother made jam and pies.  But only one time in two years. And I couldn’t understand why, why I need to wait so long?

Today left only the memory of the yard, garden and my little sweet apples. No one cared of the trees after my grandparents left.

But I remember of them every time when I wash an apple, I peel an apple, I cut an apple or I make an apple tarte. I remember about my grandparents, about my apples trees or about the child dressed in a green dress who played in the blossoming garden. They all still live in me.

1. On a clean surface, sift the flour, powdered sugar, almond powder and the pinch of salt. Gently mix with your fingers to blend the ingredients. 
2. Add the diced cold butter and start mixing with the powders until the butter is integrated into the dry ingredients. 
3. Form a well in the center and add in the beaten egg and the almond extract. In circles, rub the egg into the flour/butter blend until it forms a homogenous dough. 
4. Wrap the dough in food-foil and refrigerate it for one hour or until is cold and easy to handle.

1. In a pot, heat up the chopped apples. Add the sugar and 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon, stir well and cover.

##The garnish:

- 4 large apples or 5 little apples, cut into thin strips
- 5 tbsp butter, divided

2. Stir and cover for 5 minutes, until apples become slightly soft. Set aside.

##To assemble:

1. Preheat the oven at 175C/350F.
2. Line the dough into a tart tray. Pierce it with a fork. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown.

##Important notes:

1. To transfer the crust from your work surface to your baking pan, delicately roll it around your rolling pin and unroll over the pan/ or roll the dough directly to parchment paper and turn it face-down when is ready for the pan.
2. Once you lined your baking pan with the crust, place it in the freezer for 30 minutes before baking. This will prevent it from shrinking or getting out of shape while baking.
3. For pre-baking the crust without the filling, cut out a sheet of parchment paper, place it over the crust and cover with dry beans to pre-bake.
4. You can use apricot preserves instead of applesauce (approx. 300 g).
