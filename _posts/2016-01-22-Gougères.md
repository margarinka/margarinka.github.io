These days I was looking for some family photos when I found a forgotten album, made 5 years ago in France. There were photos of a holiday spent in the Loire river Valley. I visited friends who lived in Chinon and they assured me a wonderful holiday visiting around 12 castles. From early spring until early winter, _les châteaux_ are open to visitors with an open program for children and adults.

One of the wonderful things were the wine tasting. White, red or rosé, made by the new owners of the castles, with the possibility to buy as many bottles you want. Also with the tasting were served petite Gougères, to accompany the wine aroma.

A Gougère in French cuisine, is a baked savory choux pastry made of choux dough mixed with cheese. There are many variants. The cheese is commonly grated Gruyère, Comté, or Emmentaler, but there are many variants using other cheeses or other ingredients.  In Burgundy, they are generally served cold when tasting wine in cellars, but are also served warm as an appetizer, filled with different goodies. So these little golden pastry are ideal to accompany your aperitif drinks and impress your guests, especially as they are home-made.
